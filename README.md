# Datathon 2025 Project - Avengers Ensemble

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and modeling pipeline for our approach Datathon 2025 competition. The project is organized into multiple Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of the data analysis and modeling process.

## Project Structure

### Data Analysis and Exploration
- `datathon2025-eda.ipynb`: Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook
- `datathon2025-eda-revised.ipynb`: Revised version of the EDA with additional insights
- `datathon2025-geospatial.ipynb`: Geospatial analysis and visualization of the data
- `datathon2025-pca.ipynb`: Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction

### Machine Learning Models
- `datathon2025-linreg.ipynb`: Linear Regression model implementation
- `datathon10125-rf.ipynb`: Random Forest model implementation
- `datathon2025-nn.ipynb`: Neural Network model implementation
- `datathon2025-xgb.ipynb`: XGBoost model implementation

### Advanced Techniques
- `semisupervisedlearning-datathon2025.ipynb`: Semi-supervised learning approach
- `semisupervisedlearning-fromscratch-datathon2025.ipynb`: Implementation of semi-supervised learning from scratch
- `datathon2025-postprocessing.ipynb`: Post-processing techniques and model ensembling
